# Remote_Sensing_Deep_Learning
The goal of this project is to predict the presence, or non-presence, of rice crops at a given location. 
This repository contains my solution to Remote Sensing Open Science Data Challenge. The goal of this challenge was to predict the presence or non-presence of rice crops at a given location using satellite data from the European Copernicus (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) program and NASA's Landsat program.

Data
The data for this challenge was provided by EY and consisted of satellite images from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat for different locations around the world. The dataset also included ground truth data that indicated whether or not rice crops were present at each location.

Approach
To solve this problem, I used a combination of image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. First, I preprocessed the satellite images to extract features such as vegetation indices and texture features. Then, I used these features to train a machine learning model to predict the presence or non-presence of rice crops at a given location.

Results
After training and testing several machine learning models, I was able to achieve an accuracy of XX% on the test set. This means that my model can correctly predict the presence or non-presence of rice crops XX% of the time.

Conclusion
Overall, this project was a great learning experience and allowed me to apply my skills in data science to a real-world problem. By predicting the presence or non-presence of rice crops, we can better understand the distribution of this important crop and work toward improving food security around the world.
